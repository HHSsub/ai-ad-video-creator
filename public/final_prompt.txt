[2단계 - JSON ONLY OUTPUT]

ROLE: You are an expert video director & VFX supervisor. Convert the strategic natural-language plan (Phase 1 output) into a machine-consumable JSON storyboard for image + image-to-video generation.

CONTEXT INPUT (PHASE 1 RAW, INPUT DETAILS):
{phase1_output}

PROJECT INPUT VARIABLES:
brandName: {brandName}
industryCategory: {industryCategory}
productServiceCategory: {productServiceCategory}
productServiceName: {productServiceName}
coreTarget: {coreTarget}
videoPurpose: {videoPurpose}
videoLength: {videoLength}
coreDifferentiation: {coreDifferentiation}
videoRequirements: {videoRequirements}
brandLogoProvided: {brandLogo}
productImageProvided: {productImage}
aspectRatioCode: {aspectRatioCode}

OBJECTIVE:
Return ONLY ONE JSON object (no markdown fences, no commentary, no prose outside JSON).
This JSON will directly drive generation steps. All prompts must be in ENGLISH except brand/product proper nouns.

SCENE COUNT LOGIC:
- Derive total scenes by floor(video_length_seconds / 2). Minimum 3, maximum 60.
- Each scene duration_seconds = 2 (unless last scene needs 1~2s adjustment to not exceed length; keep it simple: still 2).
- Generate continuous timecode segments: 00:00-00:02, 00:02-00:04, etc.

IMAGE PROMPT RULES:
- Provide high-fidelity descriptive prompt (70-110 words) describing a single frozen frame.
- Begin with camera angle & shot type (e.g., "Extreme close-up," "Bust shot," "Wide shot").
- Include subject pose, orientation, micro actions, environment depth, lighting/time-of-day, color palette, mood.
- Include product or product context referencing {productServiceName} or {productServiceCategory} naturally.
- Mandatory fidelity tokens if missing: insanely detailed, micro-details, hyper-realistic textures, visible skin pores, stitching on clothing, 4K, sharp focus.
- If brandLogoProvided == '업로드됨' integrate subtle early logo presence (scene 1 or 2).
- If productImageProvided == '업로드됨' ensure tactile handling or functional usage appears in multiple scenes.
- Conclude prompt with: "Shot by [generic professional cinema camera] with a [50mm or 85mm] lens."
- Negative prompt EXACT fixed string: "blurry, low quality, watermark, cartoon, distorted"
- image.image.size = "{aspectRatioCode}"

MOTION PROMPT RULES:
- 1~3 concise English sentences describing motion from the still: subject micro-movements, camera moves (push-in, dolly, parallax), environmental animations.
- Avoid repeating static description verbatim; focus on dynamic evolution.

    }
  ]
}

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY the JSON object described (no code fences, no explanation, no markdown headers).
- Ensure all scene image_prompt.prompt end with a camera line: 'Shot by ... lens.'
- Provide realistic variation in scenes while maintaining narrative & visual coherence appropriate to {videoPurpose} and {coreTarget}.
- Use aspect_ratio value "{aspectRatioCode}" consistently in every image_prompt.image.size.
- Convert logo_provided / product_image_provided to true/false (NOT strings) using provided inputs ({brandLogo} / {productImage} where '업로드됨' -> true else false).
- If you cannot confidently fill something, still produce a syntactically valid JSON with best-effort content (no placeholders like TODO).
